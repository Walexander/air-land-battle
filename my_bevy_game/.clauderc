# Claude Code Instructions

## Git Workflow
- NEVER commit changes automatically
- ONLY create commits when the user explicitly says "commit", "commit this", "commit that", etc.
- After making code changes, wait for the user to review and explicitly request a commit
- If unsure whether to commit, ask the user first
